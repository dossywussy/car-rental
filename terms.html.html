        <p>Welcome to DriveEase Rentals. By using our services, you agree to these terms. Please read them carefully.</p>

        <h2>2. Vehicle Use and Restrictions</h2>
        <p>Vehicles must be used legally and responsibly. Prohibited activities include racing, off-road driving, transporting illegal substances, or subletting. You are liable for any damage, fines, or violations during the rental period.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Payment and Fees</h2>
        <p>Rental rates include base fees, taxes, and optional add-ons. A security deposit may be required and refunded upon return (minus any deductions for damage). Late returns incur additional charges.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Insurance and Liability</h2>
